# Bank-customer-retention-prediction

I've used an **artificial neural network** for predicting whether a particular customer will leave the bank or 
not based on various factors. 
- CreditScore 
- Geography 
- Gender
- Age
- Tenure
- Balance
- Number of products 
- whether the customer has a credit card or not
- whether the customer is an active member or not
- the customer's estimated salary

This repo contains the dataset named - Churn Modeling.csv which has been taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). 
The link to this Kaggle dataset is : https://www.kaggle.com/santoshd3/bank-customers.

*The notebook has been coded in Python.*
